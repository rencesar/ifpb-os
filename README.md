Knowing that this is a Web application We can not use time on the server because the idea is that it will be running all the time, so what We are going to do here is use `curl` to measure the response of the server.

1. With Empty database:
    ```
    $ time curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1/section/
    []
    real 0m0.021s
    user 0m0.004s
    sys  0m0.000s
    ```
2. Pushing data to the database
